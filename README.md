# Project Overview
## The Red Wine Quality Prediction project leverages machine learning techniques to assess and predict the quality of red wines. It employs a dataset that includes a wide range of chemical attributes such as acidity, pH, and alcohol content, along with quality ratings from wine experts.

# Why Red Wine Quality Prediction?
## Wine Quality Assessment: This project can be valuable for winemakers and connoisseurs who seek a reliable and data-driven method to assess wine quality.

## Data-Driven Decisions: Predicting wine quality based on chemical properties can help in making informed decisions about production and improving wine characteristics.# redwine
